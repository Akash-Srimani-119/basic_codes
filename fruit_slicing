Problem
You are given  fruits.

The weight of the fruits is represented by an array .

All those fruits which have the same weight can be sliced in one step.

Task

Your task is to determine the number of steps to slice all the fruits.

SOLVED IN PYTHON
a=int(input('enter no of frits:'))
b=[]
d=[]
n=0
for i in range(a):
    c=int(input('enter the weights:'))
    b.append(c)
    #print(b)
for j in b:
    if j not in d:
        d.append(j)
        n+=1
        #print(d)
        
print("no of steps:",n)3

OUTPUT
enter no of frits:6
enter the weights:20
enter the weights:40
enter the weights:30
enter the weights:50
enter the weights:40
enter the weights:20
no of steps: 4
